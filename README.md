now maybe someone can make a native dsi/3ds/n3ds version to support better wifi, video support, higher resolution,  implement file transfers.... effectively a barebones bbs system....


suprised nobody decided to fucking moonshell to dsi/3ds/n3ds, proabably the most used homebrew, wit no dpg needed, well atleast for dsi maybe...
