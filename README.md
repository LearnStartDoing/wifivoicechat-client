now maybe someone can make a native dsi/3ds/n3ds version to support better wifi, video support, higher resolution,  implement file transfers.... effectively a barebones bbs system....


suprised nobody decided to fucking port moonshell to dsi/3ds/n3ds, proabably the most used homebrew, wit no dpg needed, well atleast for dsi maybe...probably could just integrate this into it as an applet or plugin of sorts....

the server is not resource hungry, it could run fine on an hp1151NR netbook under win7 or jolicloud via wine, you just need a low latency connection for the host server, you probably can run it using a raspberry pi with wine installed
